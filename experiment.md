# Experimental Design - DC
### Research Design
We are trying to find out if decreasing projectile speed balances the game in the right direction, or if this makes the game far too easy.

###  Variables
Our independent variable is the projectile speed. Our dependent variable is the survival time.

### Hypothesis

If we change the projectile speed, then surival time will increase, because the player requires less reaction time, and cannot fall victim to bad RNG (projectiles spawning very close to the player).
